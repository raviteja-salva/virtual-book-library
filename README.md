# Virtual Book Library

A React-based application that allows users to browse books, view detailed information about each book, and manage their personal library.

## Features

- Browse a collection of books
- View detailed information about each book
- Search functionality to filter books by title, author, or genre
- Add books to a personal library
- Remove books from the personal library

## Pages

1. **Home Page (Book Listing)**
   - Displays a grid or list of books with basic details
   - Includes a search bar for filtering books

2. **Book Details Page**
   - Shows comprehensive information about a selected book
   - Provides an option to add the book to "My Library"

3. **My Library Page**
   - Lists books added to the user's personal collection
   - Allows removal of books from the collection

## Technical Implementation

- Built with React.js
- Routing implemented using `react-router-dom`
- State management using React's built-in hooks (`useState`, `useContext`)
- Reusable components for efficiency (BookCard, BookList, SearchBar)
- Context API used to avoid prop drilling
- Functional components and hooks used throughout
